# FICTOAN
FICTOAN is an intuitive, minimalist, responsive HTML+CSS boilerplate. 

As a designer just starting to learn basic web development, I found large frameworks such as Bootstrap and Foundation too complex and cumbersome to implement and maintain. I needed something more basic and easy to use.

And thus FICTOAN was born. It aims to be an intuitive and design-centric CSS framework for creating and themeing on projects easily. It uses simple and descriptive class names, and yet generic enough to be understood easily.

It's still a bit rough around the edges, some functionality might break, but it will be polished in due course.

### Installation

Just drop the `dist/fictoan.css` file into your project and you&rsquo;re good to go.
