# FICTOAN
FICTOAN is an intuitive, minimalist, responsive HTML+CSS boilerplate. 

As a designer just starting to learn basic web development, I found large frameworks such as Bootstrap and Foundation too complex and cumbersome to implement and maintain. I needed something more basic and easy to use.

And thus FICTOAN was born. It aims to be an intuitive and straightforward HTML and CSS framework for designers and newbie developers working on small projects or websites. It uses simple and descriptive class names, and yet generic enough to be understood easily.

You can check more details and documentation here: http://fictoan.io/

It’s still a bit rough around the edges, some functionality might break, but it will be polished in due course.

### Installation

Just [download the zip file](http://sujansundareswaran.com/fictoan/fictoan-v2.3.0.zip), and in it you will find a template file where you can just start filling content, and it'll work like magic.

### Contributing

Please do. Just keep in mind to include short, helpful comments too, as this project is aimed at absolute
newbies.

`Current version is 2.3.0`

The versioning logic is simple:
Versions are written as `major.minor.patch`. <br>
1. `0.0.INCREMENT THIS NUMBER` — for grammatical errors, typos and image corrections. Essentially, polishing the look and feel. <br>
2. `0.INCREMENT THIS NUMBER.0` — for changes in layout, changes to the code and other minor feature and functionality tweaks. Reset the patch number to zero.<br>
3. `INCREMENT THIS NUMBER.0.0` — for new major feature additions and overhauls of current functionality. Reset the minor component back to zero. <br>
